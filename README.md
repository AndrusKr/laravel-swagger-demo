## :open_mouth: What is Swagger?

According [to their own blog post](http://swagger.io/getting-started-with-swagger-i-what-is-swagger/):

[...]
> Swagger is a set of rules (in other words, a specification) for a format **describing REST APIs**. The format is both machine-readable **and human-readable**. As a result, it can be used to **share documentation** among **product managers, testers and developers**, but can also be used by various tools to automate API-related processes.
